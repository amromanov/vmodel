If you have errors during compilation about bad version of libstdc++.so.6 (in Linux) try
to follow this instruction to solve it.  (Tested on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS).

First find the system version of libstdc++.so.6.

From the command line type:

locate libstdc++.so.6

My system version of libstdc was

    /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6

Then replace the matlab libstdc version with a link to the system libstdc.

From the command line type (replace [....] with you settings):

cd [matlab_dir]/sys/os/glnx86 
mv libstdc++.so.6 libstdc++.so.6-OLD 
ln -s [your_system_version_of_libstdc] libstdc++.so.6
